   					<p>I am writing before my first day of work. This past spring, I graduated from undergrad and am finally entering the workforce. It’s funny that the typical feeling would probably be nervousness, or happiness. I feel a strong lack of emotions right now, like I don’t even care that I am going to work tomorrow, that I am taking the first step into the “adult life”. I think a primary reason for this was that it’s not where I wanted to be. During recruitment last year, I didn’t get to join the companies that I wished to join, and did not perform well enough during interviews. This has led me to my current sentiment about starting this new job as a new grad. 
   						I feel undervalued, under-appreciated, and that I’m not achieving my full potential, and this is even before the official start date. I feel trapped. Ever since university I had a plan for myself. It seems every step I take, my goals get further and further away from me. This job could potentially be a stepping stone, but it may not be a large enough stone, or even a step in the right direction, if you know what I mean. Further, I feel like I can’t be eye-to-eye with some of my peers, who went off to jobs with glamorous titles and fat salaries. I felt that in college I was playing in the same level as them, but now we are in different leagues. I feel like I am no longer relevant and can be acknowledged. So, this is my sentiment before starting work.
   						Now, to look at how I feel from a completely rational and optimistic side. 
   					<ul>
   						<li>I am ungrateful, that I have a job coming out of college. In a sense, I should feel privileged. That I have a steady income and a pretty decent job</li>
   						<li>I judge my success based off others. This is a huge problem for me, that sometimes even when I achieve something, if it’s not perceived well by my peers, then I may not even enjoy this achievement. In a sense, I am living my life for other people.</li>
   						<li>I am complaining about my “path” when I haven’t even taken a single step. Who knows what this role could turn into? What opportunities could come up? What kind of people I’ll meet? I am going into it pessimistic without anything tangible to justify it.</li>
   						<li>My negative thoughts of going into work could very well affect my performance at work and could turn an exciting opportunity into something more disastrous.
   						Even though I can view it from the other side, I can’t help but feel shitty and vulnerable. </li>
   					</ul>
