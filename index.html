   			<summary>They always said that life wouldn’t be fair. And boy did I experience that this year right before stepping into the workforce. Last year I got 2 job offers, one with a salary 10K higher than the other and more prestige...... </summary>
   			<p>I was rejected from the offer 2 days later because I didn’t have citizenship status (something I was going to get before the job start date, which I did by the way). This was highly unlucky… most companies would give you the benefit of the doubt and let you get your citizenship (I was already in the queue), to make matters worse, there were employees hired last year without even the prospect of getting a citizenship. A bit after that, I was rejected from Google’s recruiting, being cut at the “team selection” phase, a phase you enter after you’ve passed all the interviews, in which at this stage its highly unlikely to get rejected. So, I went with my satisfactory job offer, with a lot of confidence lost and not very excited about starting it. Now I’m thinking, it’ only uphill and I will work hard at it.
   			<br/><br/>Little did I know, on the first day of the job, I get switched to a division completely different from my original role. It was probably one of the worst divisions you could be in. I tried so hard to get out of it, but of course in the corporate world, no one gives a shit about you, and would not listen to how unfair it is that you signed up for something but ended up with another. This was the THIRD strike. I completely lost it. I bitched to my colleagues. I bitched to my mom. I bitched to my friends. I hit a point of depression. WTF am I going to do now. Negativity clouded my thoughts.
   				<br/><br/>On the same night, I get a call from my friend saying that after pursuing a company for 3 months and getting an offer, his offer was somehow rescinded after 8 interviews. He was promised of it for a few months now and he was set to move and start his new life. It wasn’t until 2 weeks before that his offer got rescinded. I was expecting him to bitch about his life to me. But what I heard was the opposite. Right when he received the email of his offer being rescinded, his first step of action was to immediately apply to 20 jobs. The week after he was already interviewing. 
   				<br/><br/>What is the take away here? What did I learn? Yes, life is going to be SO unfair, and you won’t even see it coming, and it could keep coming. But what do you do? No amount of complaining about unfairness can make this go away. No amount of being negative and thinking how life is unfair to you will do any good. No one will pity you. No one will give a shit. That’s the fact of life. How did I react? Well I pitied myself, complained, and clouded myself with negativity. What did my friend do? He immediately took action to change the outcome that life has given him. To tackle life, we need to know that nothing will be fair, people get lucky, people get unlucky. You can bust your balls and still lose to the guy that worked half as hard as you. You can lose your job in a second for absolutely no justification. The WORST could literally happen to you, over and over and over again. What do you do? You own it. You move on right away. Assess your situation and move the fuck on, and fight back. Take control of your goddam life. That’s what my friend did and that’s what I will do.

   			<summary>I am writing before my first day of work. This past spring, I graduated from undergrad and am finally entering the workforce. It’s funny that the typical feeling would probably be nervousness, or happiness..... </summary>
   			<p>I feel a strong lack of emotions right now, like I don’t even care that I am going to work tomorrow, that I am taking the first step into the “adult life”. I think a primary reason for this was that it’s not where I wanted to be. During recruitment last year, I didn’t get to join the companies that I wished to join, and did not perform well enough during interviews. This has led me to my current sentiment about starting this new job as a new grad. I feel undervalued, under-appreciated, and that I’m not achieving my full potential, and this is even before the official start date. I feel trapped. Ever since university I had a plan for myself. It seems every step I take, my goals get further and further away from me. This job could potentially be a stepping stone, but it may not be a large enough stone, or even a step in the right direction, if you know what I mean. Further, I feel like I can’t be eye-to-eye with some of my peers, who went off to jobs with glamorous titles and fat salaries. I felt that in college I was playing in the same level as them, but now we are in different leagues. I feel like I am no longer relevant and can be acknowledged. So, this is my sentiment before starting work. Now, to look at how I feel from a completely rational and optimistic side. I am ungrateful, that I have a job coming out of college. In a sense, I should feel privileged. That I have a steady income and a pretty decent job. I judge my success based off others. This is a huge problem for me, that sometimes even when I achieve something, if it’s not perceived well by my peers, then I may not even enjoy this achievement. In a sense, I am living my life for other people. I am complaining about my “path” when I haven’t even taken a single step. Who knows what this role could turn into? What opportunities could come up? What kind of people I’ll meet? I am going into it pessimistic without anything tangible to justify it.My negative thoughts of going into work could very well affect my performance at work and could turn an exciting opportunity into something more disastrous. Even though I can view it from the other side, I can’t help but feel shitty and vulnerable.</p>
